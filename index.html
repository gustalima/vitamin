<ul>
<li><p>This software combines several tools for protein modeling, such as BLAST 
search for templates, Modeller, procheck and PyMOL. All the process, from 
searching templates to model evaluation and refining can be done in the ViTaMIn.</p></li>
<li><p>You WILL need a valid Modeller license (free for academics, 
<a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html">https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html</a>). ViTaMIn installer will not 
install Modeller, but you can find Installation Notes for it on official website
.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the software, redistribute and make any changes in the code, as 
long as you keep original credits. For redistribuition, please consider giving 
the official link (in which you may have download this file, I hope =D). This 
way I can keep record of the number of downloads and see if my software is 
working as I planned (don't worry, no confidential records neither user ID is
recorded, it is a download counter only). </p></li>
<li><p>Please consider feedback. This is the only way to track bugs and make improves
.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>ViTaMIn depends on the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modeller (9.9 or newer)</li>
<li>pymol (0.99 or newer, 1.3+ recommended)</li>
<li>procheck </li>
<li>matplotlib (1.2 or newer)</li>
<li>biopython (1.6 or newer)</li>
<li>GTK3+</li>
<li>python (2.7.x) </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements</h2>

<p>The major job is done by Modeller, and as is, it needs a i686 or amd64 processor
to work. The faster your processor, the faster your job is done. There is no 
minimum requirements. Internet connection is required for BLAST search engine 
only, but you can use it without one if you have sequences and pdbs on your disk
.</p>

<a id="ubuntu-1204-or-newer-" class="anchor" href="#ubuntu-1204-or-newer-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ubuntu 12.04 or newer </h2>

<p>Installing ViTaMIn in Ubuntu is a straight process using the provided script 
(install). The script checks and install dependencies automatically (may require
root permission) and set procheck on your machine. Note that the procheck 
version is the most update to date provided by Roman Laskowski, with a simple 
change in the gets function (to fgets) in order to use newer versions of the cc
compiler. You can choose not to install procheck, if you already have a working
version with the 'procheck' alias.</p>

<p>For Installion, use the command in download folder:
Easy way:
open terminal (install git if you don't have it already)
git clone <a href="http://github.com/gustalima/vitamin-stable">http://github.com/gustalima/vitamin-stable</a>
cd vitamin-stable
./install</p>

<p>Without git:
Download Vitamin.tar.gz and procheck.tar.gz and install 
run the install file with the following command
./install</p>

<h2>
<a id="other-distros" class="anchor" href="#other-distros" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other distros</h2>

<p>For all other distros, you will need to get dependencies by yourself. It's not
that hard, and most distros have them in their repositories. Once your system
dependencies are OK, untar the tarball file provided in any folder and run from 
terminal. Any missing dependencies you may have will be alerted in your terminal
.</p>

<p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a></p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms 
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by 
the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.</li>
</ol>

<p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an 
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the 
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass 
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface 
provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
was made is also called the “Linked Version”.</p>

<p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding 
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the 
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, 
and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without 
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p></li>
<li><p>Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility 
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the 
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then 
you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the 
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains 
meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header 
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to 
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, 
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of 
the following:</p>

<p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library 
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>

<p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and 
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that 
permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version 
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner 
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library 
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly 
with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required
to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the 
extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified 
version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the 
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding 
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by 
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not 
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined 
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms 
of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work 
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined 
form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you 
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether 
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that 
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>
