All the process, from \r\nsearching templates to model evaluation and refining can be done in the ViTaMIn.\r\n\r\n- You WILL need a valid Modeller license (free for academics, \r\nhttps://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html). ViTaMIn installer will not \r\ninstall Modeller, but you can find Installation Notes for it on official website\r\n.\r\n\r\n- You can use the software, redistribute and make any changes in the code, as \r\nlong as you keep original credits. For redistribuition, please consider giving \r\nthe official link (in which you may have download this file, I hope =D). This \r\nway I can keep record of the number of downloads and see if my software is \r\nworking as I planned (don't worry, no confidential records neither user ID is\r\nrecorded, it is a download counter only). \r\n\r\n- Please consider feedback. This is the only way to track bugs and make improves\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling ViTaMIn under Linux\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nDependecies\r\n------------\r\nViTaMIn depends on the following packages:\r\n\r\n- Modeller (9.9 or newer)\r\n- pymol (0.99 or newer, 1.3+ recommended)\r\n- procheck \r\n- matplotlib (1.2 or newer)\r\n- biopython (1.6 or newer)\r\n- GTK3+\r\n- python (2.7.x) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n--------------------\r\nThe major job is done by Modeller, and as is, it needs a i686 or amd64 processor\r\nto work. The faster your processor, the faster your job is done. There is no \r\nminimum requirements. Internet connection is required for BLAST search engine \r\nonly, but you can use it without one if you have sequences and pdbs on your disk\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUbuntu 12.04 or newer \r\n----------------------\r\nInstalling ViTaMIn in Ubuntu is a straight process using the provided script \r\n(install). The script checks and install dependencies automatically (may require\r\nroot permission) and set procheck on your machine. Note that the procheck \r\nversion is the most update to date provided by Roman Laskowski, with a simple \r\nchange in the gets function (to fgets) in order to use newer versions of the cc\r\ncompiler. You can choose not to install procheck, if you already have a working\r\nversion with the 'procheck' alias.\r\n\r\nFor Installion, use the command in download folder:\r\nEasy way:\r\nopen terminal (install git if you don't have it already)\r\ngit clone http://github.com/gustalima/vitamin-stable\r\ncd vitamin-stable\r\n./install\r\n\r\nWithout git:\r\nDownload Vitamin.tar.gz and procheck.tar.gz and install \r\nrun the install file with the following command\r\n./install\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther distros\r\n--------------\r\nFor all other distros, you will need to get dependencies by yourself. It's not\r\nthat hard, and most distros have them in their repositories. Once your system\r\ndependencies are OK, untar the tarball file provided in any folder and run from \r\nterminal. Any missing dependencies you may have will be alerted in your terminal\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n\r\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license \r\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms \r\nand conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by \r\nthe additional permissions listed below.\r\n\r\n0. Additional Definitions.\r\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General \r\nPublic License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\r\nLicense.\r\n\r\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an \r\nApplication or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the \r\nLibrary, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass \r\nof a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface \r\nprovided by the Library.\r\n\r\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with\r\nthe Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work\r\nwas made is also called the “Linked Version”.\r\n\r\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding \r\nSource for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the \r\nCombined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, \r\nand not on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code\r\nand/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs\r\nneeded for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the\r\nSystem Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without \r\nbeing bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility \r\nrefers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the \r\nfacility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then \r\nyou may convey a copy of the modified version:\r\n\r\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure \r\nthat, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the \r\nfacility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains \r\nmeaningful, or\r\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License \r\napplicable to that copy.\r\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header \r\nfile that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of\r\nyour choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to \r\nnumerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, \r\ninline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of \r\nthe following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is \r\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license \r\ndocument.\r\n4. Combined Works.\r\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, \r\neffectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library \r\ncontained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such \r\nmodifications, if you also do each of the following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is\r\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license \r\ndocument.\r\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include\r\nthe copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference\r\ndirecting the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\nd) Do one of the following:\r\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and \r\nthe Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that \r\npermit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version \r\nof the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner \r\nspecified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\r\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A \r\nsuitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library \r\nalready present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly \r\nwith a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the \r\nLinked Version.\r\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required\r\nto provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the \r\nextent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified \r\nversion of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the \r\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option \r\n4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding \r\nSource and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must \r\nprovide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the\r\nGNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n5. Combined Libraries.\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by \r\nside in a single library together with other library facilities that are not \r\nApplications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined \r\nlibrary under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the \r\nLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms \r\nof this License.\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work \r\nbased on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined \r\nform of the same work.\r\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU \r\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be \r\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address \r\nnew problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you \r\nreceived it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General \r\nPublic License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of \r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any \r\nlater version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you \r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public \r\nLicense, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \r\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether \r\nfuture versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that \r\nproxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization\r\nfor you to choose that version for the Library.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
